                        <p>Sports events are  a source of building skills  in non-technical fields.Sports events will also help in making our body fit and healthy. The earlier methods for registering in these events were cumbersome because we had to move to the place where registration was  done. So there was a need to develop a website which will make the process of registration easier and quicker than the earlier methods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        So we decided to develop a website where everyone can easily register in events quickly and easily. The event organizer will use ‘EVENTOPEDIA’ to organize the event. The participation can register in the event by providing a validation certificate and after the event has ended, certificate will be delivered to the participants through their email addresses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The advantage of using ‘EVENTOPEDIA’ is that:
                        <ul>

                        <li> • Quick and easy participation.</li>
                        <li> • Certificate will be easily delivered to the participants.</li>
                        <li> • Approval of participants on the basis of their validation certificates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>


                        <b>Conclusion:</b>The system is developed using HTML,CSS And PHP.The database used is MYSQL and the server used is APACHE TOMCAT.
